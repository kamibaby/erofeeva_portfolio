<!-- About Text -->
<section class="hero fade-in">
  <h1>Throughout my work in EdTech, MedTech, and digital publishing, I've collaborated closely with engineers, designers, and marketing teams to understand user behavior and translate insights into practical product improvements. I've conducted user surveys, built CJMs, tested communication hypotheses, refined user flows, and launched content and feature changes that strengthened engagement and helped products grow.</h1>
  <p>Much of my work has involved shaping strategy: planning multi-month content and communication roadmaps, managing creators and production teams, coordinating releases, and improving the user experience across channels. I've run A/B tests, optimized email funnels, and iterated on landing pages, user journeys, and messaging based on qualitative and quantitative feedback.</p>
  <p>Even before formally shifting into product management, my roles naturally expanded into product tasks: discovering user needs, validating ideas, improving interfaces, proposing new product directions, and influencing how features were shaped and delivered. I enjoy working in environments where ideas evolve through collaboration, research, and experimentation.</p>
  <p>What drives me most is understanding how people think and designing solutions that feel intuitive and meaningful. I'm passionate about discovery, problem-solving, and building products that help users achieve real progress.</p>
